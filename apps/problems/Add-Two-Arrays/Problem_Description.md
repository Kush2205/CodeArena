## Problem: Add Two Integers (Easy)

Given two integer arrays, return the sum of the arrays.

This is a warm-up problem to get familiar with the platform and function-based submissions.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: a = [1,2,3], b = [4,5,6]
```

```
Output: [5,7,9]
```
##### Explanation: 3 + 5 = 8.

#### Example 2:
```
Input: a = [1], b = [2]
```

```
Output: [3]
```
##### Explanation: -2 + 10 = 8.

#### Example 3:
```
Input: a = 0, b = 0
```
```
Output: 0
```
### Constraints
- −1,000,000,000 ≤ a, b ≤ 1,000,000,000
- The result fits in a 32-bit signed integer

### Notes
- Handle negative values and zero.
- Expected time/space: O(1) / O(1).
