## Problem: Reverse Array (Easy)

Given an integer array, return the array in reversed order.

This problem tests basic array manipulation skills.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

```
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```
##### Explanation: The array is reversed.

#### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [10]
```

```
Output: [10]
```
##### Explanation: A single element array remains unchanged.

#### Example 3:
```
Input: arr = [7,8,9]
```
```
Output: [9,8,7]
```
### Constraints
- 1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 1000
- −1,000,000,000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000

### Notes
- Handle arrays of any size.
- Expected time/space: O(n) / O(n).
