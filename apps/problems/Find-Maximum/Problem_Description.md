## Problem: Find Maximum (Easy)

Given an integer array, return the maximum element in the array.

This problem tests basic array traversal and comparison skills.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [3,7,2,9,1]
```

```
Output: 9
```
##### Explanation: The maximum element is 9.

#### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [-5,-2,-10]
```

```
Output: -2
```
##### Explanation: Among negative numbers, -2 is the largest.

#### Example 3:
```
Input: arr = [42]
```
```
Output: 42
```
### Constraints
- 1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 1000
- −1,000,000,000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000

### Notes
- Handle negative values.
- Array is guaranteed to have at least one element.
- Expected time/space: O(n) / O(1).
