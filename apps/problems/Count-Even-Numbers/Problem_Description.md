## Problem: Count Even Numbers (Easy)

Given an integer array, return the count of even numbers in the array.

This problem tests basic conditional logic and counting.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

```
Output: 3
```
##### Explanation: Even numbers are 2, 4, and 6.

#### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7]
```

```
Output: 0
```
##### Explanation: No even numbers present.

#### Example 3:
```
Input: arr = [2,4,6,8]
```
```
Output: 4
```
### Constraints
- 1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 1000
- −1,000,000,000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000

### Notes
- A number is even if it's divisible by 2.
- Zero is considered even.
- Expected time/space: O(n) / O(1).
